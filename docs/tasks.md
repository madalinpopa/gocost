- [ ] Add error logging with appropriate log levels
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for non-critical errors

### Configuration
- [ ] Add support for environment variables for configuration
- [ ] Implement configuration validation
- [ ] Add support for command-line flags for overriding configuration
- [ ] Create a configuration documentation file

## Code-Level Improvements

### Testing
- [ ] Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
- [ ] Add tests for SaveData function in persistence.go
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the data persistence layer
- [ ] Add UI component tests using a mocking framework
